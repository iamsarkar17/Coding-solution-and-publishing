3
7 5
2 4 6
8 5 9 3
Starting at the bottom,
We look at 8 and 5, pick the maximum, 8 in this case, and replace the 2 in the previous row with their sum 10.
We look next at 5 and 9, pick the maximum, 9, and replace the 4 in the previous row with their sum 13.
We look lastly at 9 and 3, pick the maximum, 9, and replace the 6 in the previous row with their sum 15.
Now our array looks like:
3
7 5
10 13 15

Let’s do it again. Take the larger of 10 and 13 and add it to 7 making 20.
Take the larger of 13 and 15 and add it to 5 making 20.
Now our array looks like:
3
20 20

At last we take the larger of 20 and 20 (yes, I know they’re the same) and add it to 3 making 23.
And our array looks like:
23
The maximum total path in the triangle.
